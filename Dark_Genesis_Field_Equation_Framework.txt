Dark Genesis - Scalar Field Decay Framework

1. Field Equation of Motion (Modified Klein-Gordon)

We define the dark substrate as a homogeneous scalar field (t) evolving in an expanding universe:

  '' + 3H ' + dV/d +  ' = 0

- '' : acceleration of the field
- 3H' : Hubble friction
- dV/d : force from the potential
- ' : decay/friction term driving conversion to baryons

2. Energy Density and Pressure of the Field

  _ = (1/2) '^2 + V()
  p_ = (1/2) '^2 - V()

3. Energy Transfer Equations

  d_/dt + 3H(_ + p_) = -Q
  d_b/dt + 3H _b = +f_b Q
  d_r/dt + 4H _r = +f_r Q

Where:
- Q =  '^2
- f_b + f_r = 1 (fractions into baryons and radiation)

4. Modified Friedmann Equation

  H^2 = (8G / 3) * (_ + _b + _r)

5. Sample Potential (for decay dynamics)

  V() = V_0 * exp(- )

Other options include:
- V() = (1/2) m^2 ^2
- Plateau or hybrid models

6. Late-Time Behavior

As Q approaches zero (conversion slows), _ drops and expansion slows down. This explains cosmic acceleration's eventual slowdown.

Summary Table:

Quantity     | Description
-------------|-------------------------------
(t)         | Dark substrate scalar field
            | Decay rate
Q            | Energy transfer rate
_b          | Baryonic energy density
_r          | Radiation energy density
V()         | Scalar potential

This framework encodes the Big Bang as a decay process, respects energy conservation, and provides a simulation-ready system.
