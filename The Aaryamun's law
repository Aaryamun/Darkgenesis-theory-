The Aaryamun Law: An Expansion

1. Introduction: The Aaryamun Law is proposed as the foundational principle of the Dark Genesis theory, describing the process by which dark matter and dark energy—the "dark substrate"—undergo a catalytic transformation into baryonic matter and observable energy via events such as the Big Bang. This law provides a bridge between the pre-baryonic universe and the observable cosmos.

2. Statement of the Law: "The rate of conversion of dark substrate (dark matter and dark energy) into baryonic forms is proportional to the local energy density gradient and quantum vacuum fluctuations within a critical instability threshold."

3. Formalized Mathematical Expression: Let:

: density of dark substrate at time 

: density of baryonic matter at time 

: local energy density differential

: quantum fluctuation intensity

: proportionality constant related to spacetime topology and curvature


Then the Aaryamun Law can be expressed as:

\frac{d\rho_b}{dt} = \kappa \cdot \Delta E \cdot \delta_q \cdot f(t)

4. Interpretation:

The transformation is not uniform throughout the universe. It occurs where quantum fluctuations destabilize the dark substrate.

The initial Big Bang was the largest such instability, but local "micro-genesis" events may still occur in voids or vacuum-rich regions.


5. Thermodynamic Coherence:

The law preserves total energy, transforming the configuration of energy rather than generating or destroying it.

Entropy increases during each conversion, in line with the second law of thermodynamics.


6. Implications:

The cosmic expansion rate is linked to : as it declines, the expansion slows.

The Great Voids may be regions where  is below threshold, preventing transformation.


7. Testable Prediction:

If true, regions with anomalous CMB fluctuations or unexplained gravitational effects may correspond to conversion zones.


8. Next Steps:

Derive field equations from a Lagrangian incorporating , , and spacetime curvature.

Simulate early-universe dynamics under this law.

Search cosmological data for signs of time-varying dark substrate density.

This expansion solidifies the Aaryamun Law as a mathematically and conceptually grounded component of the Dark Genesis framework.
