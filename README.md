# Dark Genesis Theory

**Author**: [Aaryamun sharma]

## Summary
The Dark Genesis theory proposes that dark matter and dark energy are the primordial substrate of the universe. The Big Bang was not the origin of everything, but a catalyst event that converted a fraction of this dark substrate into baryonic matter.

## Key Claims
1. Dark matter and energy predate the Big Bang.
2. The Big Bang is a localized conversion event.
3. Only ~5% of the dark substrate was converted into baryonic matter.
4. As dark matter continues to convert, universal expansion slows.
5. Voids, zero-point energy, and baryon growth support this.
