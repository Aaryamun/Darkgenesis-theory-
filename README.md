## 🧠 Summary

The **Dark Genesis Theory** proposes a new origin model of the universe where **dark matter** and **dark energy** form the primordial substance—existing before baryonic matter. Contrary to conventional Big Bang cosmology, this theory posits:

- The **Big Bang was not the absolute beginning** of existence.
- It was a **conversion event**, triggering a transformation of dark substrate into baryonic matter.
- This process is **ongoing**, and the expansion of the universe is linked to the gradual conversion of dark energy into baryonic forms.

## 🌟 Theory Highlights

- **Primordial Substance**: Universe initially composed entirely of dark matter and dark energy.
- **Catalyst Event**: The Big Bang was a dynamic conversion phase, not a singularity of origin.
- **Expansion Explained**: The universe expands as dark energy continues to convert into matter.
- **Future Prediction**: Expansion may slow or stop as the convertible substrate is depleted.
